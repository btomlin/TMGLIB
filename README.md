TMG library

This is the mumps code to support software for the Family Physicians of Greeneville
site (TMG).  It is under ongoing development for our purposes as an active medical
office.  The primary goal is for our own use, but we share with others in hope
that our code may be of some help to others.

The code is provided as-is, with no guarantee of usability or stability.  Users of
this libarary take full responsibility for any difficulty or harm that might arise
from it's use.

Please contact me directly for any questions or concerns via my personal email at
